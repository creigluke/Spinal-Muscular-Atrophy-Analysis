ML Analysis for the Type of Spinal Muscular Atrophy


The R Markdown file for the ML Models done for Classifying the type of Spinal Muscular Atrophy found in an Individual. 

The project uses Colombia's Spinal Muscular Atrophy dataset to put the data into the 4 defined SMA types, Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV, based on factors such as number of copies and Type of Survivor Motor Neuron Genes: SMN1 and SMN2. Locomotion was another factor used for analysis.

3 Machine Learning Techniques were used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Algorithm 

Support Vector Machine Algorithm showed the highest accuracy of around 95% while classifying the type of SMA based on the 4 SMA types.
